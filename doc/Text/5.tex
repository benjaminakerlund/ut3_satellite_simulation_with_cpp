\subsection{Working Environment: VM and SimTG}

List the problems we have had with SimTG
- step() function problems
- VM installation failing and needing to reinstall whole environment

Solution: Create models and tests directly in the directory for the example project \texttt{Add} instead of trying to create a completely new directory for this project and re-configuring everything to work (e.g. some students experienced problems with libraries).
