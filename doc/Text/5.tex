The CSS model, containing the orientation and baffle, as well as the 4 photo-cells, was successfully tested. For the controller, the PID was tested and it yields the correct result, even though the behaviour is not what was intended. The complete satellite was tested, but the output is bunch of zeros. There is some kind of bug somewhere and a further investigation would be required to fix it. Therefore, all the components were successfully implemented but connecting the components to each other to form the complete satellite could not be finished.
