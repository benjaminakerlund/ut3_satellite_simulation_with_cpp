    \textbf{Date} & \textbf{Time} & \textbf{Activity} & \textbf{Remarks} \\ \hline\hline
    
        2025-10-02 & 2h & Lecture  &  Introduction to course. C++ basics \\ \hline
        
        2025-10-30 & 2h & Lecture  &   Object Oriented Programming \\ \hline
        
        2025-11-20 & 2h & Lecture  &  Pointers, References and Const \\ \hline
        
        2025-11-27 & 4h & Lecture  &  Polymorphism \& Inheritance. Template Class and STL.  \\ \hline
        
        2025-12-11 & 4h & Lecture \& Exercise  &  Lecture on Satellite Simulation. Began installing Ubuntu 16.04.07 with \textit{Oracle VM VirtualBox}. \\ \hline
        
        2025-12-18 & 4h & Exercise &  Setup of Virtual Machine with whole class, problems in extracting the SimTG environment and setting this up on the VM. \\ \hline
        
        2025-01-08 & 4h & Exercise &  Continuing to work with VM and SimTG, finally getting the environment to work and first example models and tests to run (\texttt{simple} and \texttt{multi}).  \\ \hline

        2025-01-15 & 4h & Exercise &  Problems with assigning custom variables, arrays etc. to classes. Problems with \texttt{step()} function and testing how this works. SimTG installation broke on one computer, needed to reinstall everything. \\ \hline
        
        2025-01-20 & 4h & Exercise &  Began working on model for solar cell, still some problems with creating new projects in SimTG. Decided to just use template project (\texttt{Add}) with template files/models (\texttt{simple} and \texttt{multi}) and develop our simulation directly in this project folder to avoid problems with importing libraries etc.     
        \\ \hline
        
        2025-01-29 & 4h & Exercise &  Last session in class.  \\ \hline

        2025-01-30 & 4h & Independent work & Learning to use SimTG, reading the code in the example projects. \\ \hline

        2025-02-20 & 6h & Independent work & Working on the controller. \\ \hline
        
        2025-02-21 & 4h & Independent work &  Finishing touches on Cell model + creating report file. \\ \hline

        2025-02-24 & 8h & Independent work & Trying to get the satellite model working, testing individual models. \\ \hline

        2025-02-25 & 8h & Independent work &  Creation of CSS model + work on report. Problems with building project in SimTG... Creating testfiles for Cell and CSS. \\ \hline

        2025-02-26 & 6h & Independent work &  Getting tests for Cell to pass, lot of debugging. Implemented Baffle. Adding changes to Orientation and Baffle model, adding changes to CSS model. Finished tests for CSS. \\ \hline

        2025-02-27 & 8h & Independent work & Working on the PID part of the controller, fixing issues with SimTG, testing the Satellite model. \\ \hline
        
        2025-02-28 & 2h & Exam &    \\ \hline
